Users can choose or enter their response, get immediate feedback, and move seamlessly on to the next query. Distractions are minimized by the simple, minimalist style, which keeps users interested and learning focused.

• Next Button: After responding to the current question, users can proceed to the next flashcard by clicking the Next button.

Depending on the options, the app can be set up to either allow or prohibit progression if the current question has not been addressed yet.

Score Layout: 

Introduction

Score Output: 

The score output provides users with a summary of their performance at the end of each quiz. It includes: 

Total Score: The raw score, which is typically shown as an overall score based on correct responses (e.g., 8/10). 

 

 Correct Answers:

This output aids users in assessing their comprehension of the subject matter, monitoring their development over time, and maintaining motivation to get better. 

 

• Review Button: After finishing the quiz, users can go back and review their responses by clicking the Review button. When pressed, a summary of each question is shown, including the user's chosen response, the right response, and any comments. This strengthens users' comprehension of the subject matter and enables them to grow from their errors. A fantastic tool for expanding knowledge and monitoring development over time is the Review feature.
